The tables on this page list the IDs that you can use to install Visual Studio by using the command line. Note that we will add additional components as we release updates to Visual Studio.

Also note the following about the page:

    Each workload has its own section, followed by the workload ID and a table of the components that are available for the workload.
    By default, the Required components will be installed when you install the workload. If you choose to, you can also install the Recommended and Optional components.
    We've also added a section that lists the additional components that are not affiliated with any workload.

For more information about how to use these IDs, see Use Command-Line Parameters to Install Visual Studio 2017 page. And, for a list of workload and component IDs for other products, see Visual Studio 2017 Workload and Component IDs page.
